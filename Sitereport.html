<div class="report"><h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>As this was my very first experience of using Html and Css so, i had to face many more difficulties in this assignment.But due the help and guidance provided by our module Mr. Ankit Thapa in our regular class i was able to complete my assignment even though it was abit hard in the beginning phase as it was the first time i was doing these kind of assignment using html and css. As I was completely unknown about the uses of designing, coding,debugging process etc but our module Mr.Ankit Thapa helped us during our assignment by conducting online classes.While doing my assignment i faced many more problems so, i took some help too from the online sites like Youtube,Google.And the use of github was also completely new thing to me so i learned about checking the status,committing,pushing,cloning,adding the files etc in github with the help of gitbash from our module. there occured many problems too while doing those thing but later it was solved by the help of our module. During the time of assignment i get to learn many things from my mistakes and errors occured in github like to initiating the files before checking the status and pushing it to the guthub,closing the tags in html amd also the use of appropriate desin in css etc.Some images were downloaded to use in the backgroud of homepage and place holder image was also downloaded to use it in the portfolio page.there is overall same menu barin each of the web page which is linked to each other.The media query was used to make the web pages responsive in different mobile view,tabs,PC etc where some notes were provied from our module regarding this problem.And lastly the observation about all the web pages,explanation,errors,validations,references, etc are given below.
